    "##  Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to build a predictive model that determines whether a client will subscribe to a **bank term deposit**, based on data collected from direct marketing campaigns conducted via phone calls. The goal is to empower the bank‚Äôs marketing team with insights and tools to better target potential subscribers, improve campaign efficiency, and reduce operational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The bank is investing in direct marketing campaigns, but not all efforts lead to successful conversions. By identifying the characteristics and behaviors of clients who are most likely to subscribe, the bank can focus its resources on high-probability leads ‚Äî ultimately improving the **Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predict Client Behavior**: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a client will say *‚Äúyes‚Äù* or *‚Äúno‚Äù* to subscribing to a term deposit.\n",
    "- **Discover Key Drivers**: Identify and interpret the factors that significantly influence a client's decision to subscribe.\n",
    "- **Support Decision-Making**: Provide actionable recommendations that the marketing team can use to optimize targeting strategies and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- A classification model with strong performance, measured by:\n",
    "  - Accuracy\n",
    "  - Precision\n",
    "  - Recall\n",
    "  - F1-Score\n",
    "- A well-documented and reproducible end-to-end analysis using version control.\n",
    "- Business insights that are interpretable and actionable by stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the most influential factors that determine whether a client subscribes?\n",
    "2. Are certain client demographics (age, job, education) more likely to subscribe?\n",
    "3. Does the timing or duration of the last contact influence subscription rates?\n",
    "4. Are previous interactions with the bank predictive of subscription?\n",
    "5. Can we identify client segments with higher subscription potential?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Hypothesis Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis):** Duration of the last contact has **no significant effect** on a client‚Äôs likelihood to subscribe to a term deposit.  \n",
    "**H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis):** Duration of the last contact **significantly affects** a client‚Äôs likelihood to subscribe.\n",
    "\n",
    " This hypothesis will be tested using statistical and visual analysis during the EDA phase.\n"
